# Ethical Reflection: Punto Neutro News App
**1-Minute Script**

---

## Script (60 seconds)

"Working on Punto Neutro has made me think deeply about the ethics of what I build every day.

Starting with my personal responsibility—every feature I've coded shapes how people understand truth. When I built the analytics dashboard showing which sources users distrust, or the rating system that scores reliability, I realized I'm not just writing code—I'm influencing how thousands of people judge what's real. That's heavy. So I made choices: the personalization algorithm doesn't trap you in a bubble, reading history stays on your device unless you choose to share it, and the category tracking ensures you see diverse perspectives.

Then there's the bigger picture—society and the environment. The infinite scroll I implemented? It actually saves energy by loading news in batches instead of all at once. Dark mode isn't just aesthetic—it extends battery life and reduces e-waste. But I won't pretend everything's perfect. Real-time updates and image prefetching eat up bandwidth and server power. Every notification I trigger costs energy. It's a constant balancing act between making the app smooth and keeping our environmental footprint small.

Finally, the ethical gray zones in what I've built. The bookmark sync—is that a helpful feature or am I tracking what you care about? The notification system could keep you informed or just hijack your attention. The community rating system democratizes fact-checking, which is powerful, but what if it becomes a tool for silencing unpopular truths?

My takeaway? I can't just chase metrics or perfect code. Every feature needs to ask: does this respect people's autonomy? Does this serve truth or just engagement? Am I building something that makes the world better, or just more addictive?"
